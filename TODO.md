# To Do
A list of improvements I need to make to this website.

- Set correct value for Content-Security-Policy in meta so it doesn't interfere with inline styles.
   - Can Content-Security-Policy be included in header using current deployment workflow?
- Update style and layput to look nicer. These sites are great!:
    - https://matthiasott.com
    - https://mxb.dev
- Enable share buttons, or not
- PostCSS doesn't seem to be picking up HTML class changes
    - Maybe needs build to reset?
- Integrate https://www.speedlify.dev/
- Move mobile menu to the right-hand side
- Update link colours
- Add all necessary bits to head
    - manifest.json
    - opengraph
    - canonical
    - author info
