# To Do
A list of improvements I need to make to this website.

- Set correct value for Content-Security-Policy in meta so it doesn't interfere with inline styles.
   - Can Content-Security-Policy be included in header using current deployment workflow?
- Update style and layput to look nicer. These sites are great!:
